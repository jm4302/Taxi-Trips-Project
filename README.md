# Taxi-Trips-Project

The Taxi Trips Project is a python program what was used to characterize and forecast demand for Green Taxi Trips for December of 2016. By doing so, the 
results will inform and assist taxi drivers of trip characteristics, provide an understanding of hourly ride demand by location and learn approaches on how to optimize fares. 
To run this notebook, please make sure to include the `taxi_zone_lookup.csv` file in your directory and download `green_tripdata_2016-12.csv` dataset from:
